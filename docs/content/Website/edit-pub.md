Now you can edit any page within WebAppView (For Frontend) & Mortgage-Market (For Middleware). 

To publish the project, go to: 
- Build > Publish Project > Publish 

Now copy the files inside ```mortgagemarket``` to ```beta/``` on the directory. Check everything is working fine and then copy the edited files to the main directory at ```/httpdoc/``` on the plesk server. 

**Between beta to main site migration, it is recommended to run a Ahref crawl however it is not necessary. Contact for more info.*
